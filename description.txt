Boids... they are beautiful creatures but you can only watch them haven't you ever wanted to frolic with them?
Well now you can, show them the world and fight mobs with them (they love that btw) and fly with a flock of Boids.

The boids algorithm is a flocking simulation and looks amazing so i thought why not see it in Terraria?
